# 1
 we are solving arc agi using maths we devised. pls read @docs/anchors/00_math_spec.md and tell me what u understand

 # 2
  pls read @docs/worked_examples.md  to see how math actually solves them.

# 3
now i want u to read @docs/anchors/01_engineering_spec.md and 
@docs/anchors/02_determinism_addendum.md and assess for urself if this aligns with @docs/anchors/00_math_spec.md and ur understanding.
looking at this can u establish:
1. with these specs that engineering = math. The program is the proof.
2. u can see that debugging is reduced to algebra
3. no room for hit and trials
